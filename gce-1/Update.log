This version is modified from version v1.0.0;
Fix a bug in load_freq(), new code is: if(depth_num >= Depth_Num); old code is: if(depth_num > Depth_Num);
Modify discrete_model() and continuous_model(), replace output "now_node" with "kmer_num - low_kmer_num";
Update usage(), emphasize that "-f" and "-g" option must both be set for gce, in order to get accuarate estimation;
Increase the default value for option "-M", from 256 to 1000, which will be more sensitive and not too slow;
